"""
Module for signal handling in the board app.

This module defines signal handlers that automatically trigger specific actions
after certain events in the `Ad` model. The signal handlers utilize Djangoâ€™s
`post_save` signal to perform tasks immediately after an `Ad` instance is created.

Functions:
    - schedule_ad_deactivation: Schedules a background task to deactivate an ad after a set period.
    - send_notification: Sends a notification email to the user when an ad is created.
